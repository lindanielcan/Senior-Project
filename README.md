# Senior-Project
Can's Senior project, a simple stock analysis iso app.
To test and run the program, you may or may not need to import the chart library http://github.com/danielgindi/Charts.git
make sure the chart version is 3.6.0 
currently, the macd indicator does not supprt for the 5-minute chart, 
I will make a few more adjustments before the presentation of my senior project.
